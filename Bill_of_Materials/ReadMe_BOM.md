Bill of Materials for the PUMA Microscope
=========================================

The spreadsheet herein gives detailed information on the types and numbers of 3D printed models and non-printed materials (nuts, bolts, optics, *etc.*) required to build various PUMA systems. Example sources where you can purchase non-printed items are also given. Where items are common, example purchase sources are simply stated as 'General Hardware store' or similar. Where items are more specialised then example seller URLs are given (mostly for AliExpress and eBay sellers).
**Please note that a link to a particular seller does NOT imply any guarantee of quality or reliability or best price or similar endorsement of that seller.**

The prefix MD_ is used to specify a PUMA module.

The prefix CF_ is used to specify a PUMA configuration.

A configuration is a whole working microscope which is made up of various modules.

Information is also provided about the weight of parts, modules and configurations. These weights are approximate.

This file does not include information about how to construct the modules.

Disclaimer
----------
This is a complex and detailed document and errors or omissions may have been made. If these are pointed out to me or otherwise come to light in future I will be happy to correct them but as with all the PUMA project, those who chose to build a PUMA system do so at their own risk.
