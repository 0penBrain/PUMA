PUMA 3D Printing Files
======================

This folder contains information about printing STL files associated witht he PUMA microscope project. 

STL files are not stored in the GitHub repository because many of them are too large (over 25 MB). However the information in the 'PUMA_HowTo_Print' explains how to generate the STL files from the source (i.e. the CAD files) as well as giving information about how to print them. The information provided here relates to prints made with the Ender3. Other printers may require modifications of the advice given.

The folder 'CE3_Cura' provides Cura (version 4.8.0) profiles that are suitable for the Creality Ender3 printer using standard PLA filament. If you don't use that printer or filament type then you would need to find your own 'best' profiles for printing the models.
